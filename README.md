# Trip Planner

## Overview
### Description
User can use the app to plan the trip and generate a route to visit the attractions of their interest. The app generates a list of attractions in this city. Then user is able to select the attractions they want to visit. After clicking create, close to most effective route is created for the user to visit all of attractions they picked.

App will utilize TripAdvisors and Google Maps API to get the attractions and their locations in the city, and then display a map with markers marking the attractions and highlighted route that connects the markers. Trip Planner will also implement the algorithm that will try to come up with the close to most efficient solution. App will also use Parse to store the user's username, password, profile picture, past trips, etc.

Additional Features:
1. Adding friends to your trip. If friends are going on a trip together, when creating a new trip, user is able to  look up and add their friends to the trip. When the user selects attractions and clicks create, app will combine the attractions list with user's friends attraction lists (if a few users want to see Eiffel Tower, combined list will include it) and create a finalized most efficient route.
2. After generating the route, app will identify which attraction contributes to the total trip time most and will let the user now about it, suggesting a potential removal of this attraction from the list. User can remove the attraction, from the route page if they decide to do so.
